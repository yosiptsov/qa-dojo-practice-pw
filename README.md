# QA-DOJO-PRACTICE-PW

A collection of Playwright end-to-end and unit tests for various demo web applications, including [coffee-cart.app](https://coffee-cart.app), [demo.learnwebdriverio.com](https://demo.learnwebdriverio.com), [demoqa.com](https://demoqa.com), [playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev), and [saucedemo.com](https://saucedemo.com).  
The project demonstrates advanced Playwright usage, Page Object Model, component abstraction, and utility/unit testing in TypeScript.

## Features

- **Playwright E2E Tests**: Covers UI flows for multiple demo apps.
- **Page Object Model**: Reusable page/component abstractions for maintainable tests.
- **Unit Tests**: Utility and algorithmic function tests using Playwrightâ€™s test runner.
- **Data-driven Testing**: Uses external JSON files for test data.
- **Component Abstraction**: Shared UI logic for complex pages.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Run All Tests

```sh
npx playwright test
```

### Run Tests for a Specific Project

```sh
npx playwright test --project=coffee-cart
npx playwright test --project=demo.learnwebdriverio.com
npx playwright test --project=demoqa.com
npx playwright test --project=playwright.dev
npx playwright test --project=saucedemo
```

### View Test Report

After running tests, open the HTML report:

```sh
npx playwright show-report
```

## Customization

- **Test Data**: Modify or add JSON files in the relevant test folders for data-driven scenarios.
- **Page Objects/Components**: Extend or add new classes in `apps/saucedemoApp/` or similar folders for new UI flows.

## Notable Packages

- [`@playwright/test`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-intro): Main test runner.
- [`@faker-js/faker`](https://fakerjs.dev/): Random data generation for tests.
- `pw-hm-npm-test-package`, `is-even-check-new`: Example npm packages for demonstration.
